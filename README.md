This is a JavaScript Quiz created using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz presents questions to the user and calculates a score for the user based on how much time is left at the end of the quiz. Each incorrect answer deducts 10 seconds/points. Users are able to store their high scores locally and clear high scores as well.
